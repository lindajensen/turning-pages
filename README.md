# Fullstack Project @ IT-Högskolan in Gothenburg

Turning Pages is a web application inspired by Goodreads, designed for book enthusiasts who want to discover new books and manage their personal reading lists. Users can browse a collection of books, add them to their own reading lists, and keep track of their reading journey in one place. The application also has an admin interface to manage book data.

**Note:**

> The login credentials for the admin panel are hardcoded for demonstration purposes:
> **Username:** `admin` > **Password:** `qwerty`

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Install dependencies and start development servers

First, start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, in a separate terminal, start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend and the frontend on their respective ports.

# Ideas for Future Development

- **Reading Challenge of the Year** – A progress bar that shows how many books you've read out of your yearly goal.
- **Monthly Challenges** – For example, "Read a classic" or "Read a book by an author from another country."
- **Book Lists** – Predefined lists that users can check off, such as "100 Books to Read Before You Die."
- **Personal Goals** – Users can set their own goals, like "Read for 30 minutes a day" or "Read 10 books this year."
- **Form for adding your own book to your reading list.**
